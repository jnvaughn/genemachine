Our group is part of the USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS), and we are closely affiliated with the University of Georgia in Athns, Georgia.  We are fortunate to be able to pursue internal research interests as well as make a substantial contirubtion to many ARS projects across the Southeastern United States.  Please contact use with questions, particularly if your are looking for graduate or postdoctoral experience that intersects crop improvement, genomics, and bioinformatics.
