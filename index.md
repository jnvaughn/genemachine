Our group is part of the USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS), and we are closely affiliated with the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia.  We have lab-specific research interests but also contribute bioinformatic and design support for many ARS projects across the Southeastern United States.  Please contact us with questions, particularly if you are looking for graduate or postdoctoral experience that intersects crop improvement, genomics, and bioinformatics.  

## Open Positions

#### Postdoctoral researcher in the genomics of pollinator biology 
A two-year fully funded position with possibility of extension.  In collaboration with the USDA's [Honey Bee Lab](https://www.ars.usda.gov/southeast-area/baton-rouge-la/honeybeelab/), this position will focus on the genomics of both domesticated bees and Apis genus as a whole.
